    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch
          baking dish. Place a mixing bowl in the freezer to chill.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Make pastry shell: Combine water, butter, and salt in a medium
          saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to
          medium and stir in flour. Cook and stir until mixture pulls away from
          the sides of the pan and forms a ball. Transfer mixture to a mixing
          bowl and beat in eggs, one at a time, until fully incorporated. Spread
          dough evenly in the bottom of the prepared baking dish.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. (The
          dough will rise and make a boat shape, but should drop as it cools.)
          Cool completely on a wire rack.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Make filling: Remove the chilled mixing bowl from the freezer and pour
          in cold whipping cream. Whip until cream thickens, about 1 minute.
          Stir in confectioners' sugar and vanilla. Continue to whip until cream
          forms stiff peaks. Place whipped cream in the refrigerator to keep
          chilled.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Pour pudding mixes and milk into a separate mixing bowl and stir until
          creamy. Fold in whipped cream. Spread filling over cooled crust and
          refrigerate.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Make ganache: Place chopped chocolate in a heat-proof bowl. Bring
          cream almost to a boil in a small saucepan over medium heat. Pour hot
          cream over chocolate; let sit for 1 minute, then whisk until smooth.
          Let cool until ganache is thickened, about 10 minutes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Pour ganache over cream filling, spreading to cover the entire
          surface. Return the pan to the refrigerator and chill for at least 1
          hour before serving.
